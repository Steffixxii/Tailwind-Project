    <p class="pt-5">
     Tailwind CSS is a popular and <span class="font-bold italic">powerful CSS
     framework </span>that provides a set of pre-defined CSS classes
     that can be used to quickly and easily style HTML elements. The
     framework is designed to be highly customizable, allowing developers
     to easily create custom styles and layouts
     without having to write CSS from scratch.
    </p>
    <p class="pt-5">
     One of the key benefits of Tailwind CSS is that it promotes
     consistency in design by providing a set of pre-defined classes that
     can be used across an entire website or application. This helps to
     ensure that all elements are styled consistently, which can make it
     <span> easier to maintain and update the design over time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pt-5">
     Examples of such utility classes includes the
     <span class="font-bold">"text-center"</span> class can be used to center align text,
     while the <span class="font-bold">"bg-gray-200"</span> class can be used to add a light
     gray background color to an element.
    </p>
    <div class="mt-5 bg-gradient-to-r from-indigo-500 via-purple-500 to-pink-500">

        Overall, Tailwind CSS is a great choice for developers looking for a
        powerful and customizable CSS framework that promotes consistency in
        design and makes it easy to create responsive designs.
